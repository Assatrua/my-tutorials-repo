## Prerequisites

 - **Proficiency:** Beginner
 - Two SAP HANA databases and an SAP HANA Data Lake instance 13333
 - You have completed the first 3 tutorials in this group.


### Create a remote source from SAP HANA, express edition to SAP HANA Cloud SAP HANA Cloud

1. From the SAP HANA Cloud Cockpit, open the SAP HANA database explorer.

 - **Proficiency:** Beginner
2. Execute the following SQL statements to create the `tourist_reviews` table.

    >If needed, first create a schema and user.
    ```SQL
    CREATE SCHEMA HOTEL;
    CREATE USER USER1 PASSWORD Password1 no force_first_password_change;
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA HOTEL TO USER1;
    ```

    ```SQL [3, 5, 1]
    CREATE COLUMN TABLE hotel.tourist_reviews(
        review_id INTEGER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
        review_date DATE NOT NULL,
        destination_id INTEGER,
        destination_rating INTEGER,
        review CHAR(500) NOT NULL
    );

    INSERT INTO hotel.tourist_reviews(review_date, destination_id, destination_rating, review) VALUES('2019-12-24', 1, 5, 'We had a great day swimming at the beach and exploring the beach front shops.  We will for sure be back next summer.');
    INSERT INTO hotel.tourist_reviews(review_date, destination_id, destination_rating, review) VALUES('2019-11-13', 1, 4, 'We had an enjoyable meal.  The service and food was outstanding.  Would have like to have slightly larger portions');
    ```

3. The result can be seen below.  

    ```SQL
    SELECT * FROM HOTEL.TOURIST_REVIEWS;
    ```

### SAP HANA Data Lake

[SAP HANA Data Lake](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_HANA_DATA_LAKE/cloud/en-US) can be used to store large amounts of data that is not accessed frequently.  The following steps create the table `tourist_reviews` in SAP HANA Data Lake and access the table from the associated SAP HANA Cloud instance and from an SAP HANA, express edition database.

1. In the SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit, add an SAP HANA Data Lake instance to your SAP HANA Cloud instance, if it does not already exist.

    ![add a SAP HANA Data Lake](add_Data_Lake.png)

2. In a SQL console connected to the HANA Cloud instance, execute the following SQL to create a table named `tourist_reviews` and populate it with a few rows in SAP HANA Data Lake.

    ```SQL[1, 3-5]
    CALL SYSRDL#CG.REMOTE_EXECUTE('
    BEGIN
        CREATE TABLE TOURIST_REVIEWS (
        REVIEW_ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        REVIEW_DATE DATE NOT NULL,
        DESTINATION_ID INTEGER,
        DESTINATION_RATING INTEGER,
        REVIEW VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL
      );
      INSERT INTO TOURIST_REVIEWS(REVIEW_ID, REVIEW_DATE, DESTINATION_ID, DESTINATION_RATING, REVIEW) VALUES(1, ''2019-12-24'', 1, 5, ''We had a great day swimming at the beach and exploring the beach front shops.  We will for sure be back next summer.'');
      INSERT INTO TOURIST_REVIEWS(REVIEW_ID, REVIEW_DATE, DESTINATION_ID, DESTINATION_RATING, REVIEW) VALUES(2, ''2019-11-13'', 1, 4, ''We had an enjoyable meal.  The service and food was outstanding.  Would have like to have slightly larger portions'');
    END');
    ```

    For additional details consult [Creating a Data Lake Table](https://help.sap.com/viewer/071308868de34b289a6b1553b8cc37b9/cloud/en-US/d78a08b242274b36bb276b7096f6c35b.html).

3. Notice that under remote sources, there is a connection named `SYSRDL#CG_SOURCE`.  This is the remote source for the SAP HANA Data Lake that is associated with the SAP HANA Cloud instance.

    ![SAP HANA Data Lake Remote Source](remote_source_DL.png)

4. Create a virtual table in SAP HANA Cloud named **`VT_DL_TOURIST_REVIEWS`** in the schema **HOTEL** that maps to the newly created table in SAP HANA Data Lake.

    ![virtual data lake table](virtual_table_data_lake.png)

    This can be visualized as follows:

    ![data lake and on-premise remote connection](dl_cloud_connection.png)

5. Query the local SAP HANA table and the equivalent SAP HANA Data Lake table.

    ```SQL
    SELECT * FROM HOTEL.TOURIST_REVIEWS;
    SELECT * FROM HOTEL.VT_DL_TOURIST_REVIEWS;
    ```

    ![Query SAP HANA Data Lake](query_data_lake.png)

6. Another SAP HANA instance such as the SAP HANA, express edition can also access tables in the SAP HANA Cloud database and the SAP HANA Data Lake via a remote connection.  

     ![virtual table to DL from on-premise](virtual_table_data_lake2.png)

     This can be visualized as follows:

     ![data lake and on-premise remote connection](cloud_dl_onprem_connection.png)

7. Query a few local tables, a remote table in SAP HANA Cloud, and a remote table in the SAP HANA Data Lake.

    ```SQL
    SELECT * FROM HOTEL.RESERVATION;
    SELECT * FROM HOTEL.CUSTOMER;
    SELECT * FROM HOTEL.VT_TOURIST_REVIEWS;
    SELECT * FROM HOTEL.VT_DL_TOURIST_REVIEWS;

    SELECT C.NAME, TR.REVIEW, TR.REVIEW_DATE
    FROM
        HOTEL.RESERVATION AS R JOIN
        HOTEL.VT_TOURIST_REVIEWS AS TR
        ON TR.REVIEW_DATE = R.ARRIVAL JOIN
        HOTEL.CUSTOMER AS C
      ON C.CNO = R.CNO;

    SELECT C.NAME, TR.REVIEW, TR.REVIEW_DATE
    FROM
        HOTEL.RESERVATION AS R JOIN
        HOTEL.VT_DL_TOURIST_REVIEWS as TR
        ON TR.REVIEW_DATE = R.ARRIVAL JOIN
        HOTEL.CUSTOMER AS C
      ON C.CNO = R.CNO;
    ```

    ![results](results.png)

8. Add a new review.

    ```SQL
    INSERT INTO HOTEL.VT_DL_TOURIST_REVIEWS VALUES(3, '2020-08-21', 1, 5, 'The harbour cruise was fantastic.  It was great to see the city from a different viewpoint');
    SELECT * FROM HOTEL.VT_DL_TOURIST_REVIEWS;
    ```    

    Notice that the remote data source is updateable.  Data stored in an SAP HANA Data Lake is stored on disk, which is less costly than memory storage. SAP HANA Data Lake can also store larger amounts of data.

    For additional details on remote sources and virtual tables using two HANA Cloud instances, see [Getting Started with SAP HANA Cloud VII | Remote Data Source (multicloud)](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/08/03/getting-started-with-sap-hana-cloud-vii-smart-data-access/).

    For information on how to connect from SAP HANA Cloud to an on-premise SAP HANA instance, see the replay of the workshop [Access Data Across Your On-Premise and Cloud Data Sources](https://saphanajourney.com/hana-cloud/sap-hana-cloud-workshops/).



Congratulations!   You have now used remote sources to access data running on a different SAP HANA instance and on a SAP HANA Data Lake.

### Create a tourist review table in SAP HANA Cloud

1. From the SAP HANA Cloud Cockpit, open the SAP HANA database explorer.


2. Execute the following SQL statements to create the `tourist_reviews` table.

    >If needed, first create a schema and user.
    ```SQL
    CREATE SCHEMA HOTEL;
    CREATE USER USER1 PASSWORD Password1 no force_first_password_change;
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA HOTEL TO USER1;
    ```

    ```SQL
    CREATE COLUMN TABLE hotel.tourist_reviews(
        review_id INTEGER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
        review_date DATE NOT NULL,
        destination_id INTEGER,
        destination_rating INTEGER,
        review CHAR(500) NOT NULL
    );

    INSERT INTO hotel.tourist_reviews(review_date, destination_id, destination_rating, review) VALUES('2019-12-24', 1, 5, 'We had a great day swimming at the beach and exploring the beach front shops.  We will for sure be back next summer.');
    INSERT INTO hotel.tourist_reviews(review_date, destination_id, destination_rating, review) VALUES('2019-11-13', 1, 4, 'We had an enjoyable meal.  The service and food was outstanding.  Would have like to have slightly larger portions');
    ```

3. The result can be seen below.  

    ```SQL
    SELECT * FROM HOTEL.TOURIST_REVIEWS;
    ```
